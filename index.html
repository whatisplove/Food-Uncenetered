<b>Sukiyaki</b> is a stew whose every element can be known and recognized, since it is made in front of you, on your table, without interruption while you are eating it. The raw substances are gathered together and brought to the table on a tray: it is the very essence of the market that comes to you, its freshness, its naturalness, its diversity, and even its classification, which turns the simple substance into the promise of an event. â€“ Roland Barthes
